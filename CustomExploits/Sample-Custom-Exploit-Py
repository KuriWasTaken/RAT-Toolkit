#On the first line define if the exploit is to be generated or be a exploit
#Then define the extension separated by a ":"
#Now you can write the code for your exploit

#Current Supported keywords are "LISTENADDR", "LISTENPORT", "REMOTEADDR", "REMOTEPORT"
#Use these in the code wherever you want the user of the exploit to inser data
#"LISTENADDR" = "LHost", "LISTENPORT" = "LPort", "REMOTEADDR" = "RHost", "REMOTEPORT" = "RPort"
#Here is a sample exploit:

print("LISTENADDR") #LISTENADDR will be replaced with what thee user enters for LHost in thr Rat-Toolkit script! same for all the other keywords but with their variable
